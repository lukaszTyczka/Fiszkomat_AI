          question="What is the purpose of the useEffect Hook?"
          answer="useEffect lets you perform side effects in function components. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in React class components, but unified into a single API."

        <Flashcard
          question="What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?"
          answer="Controlled components have their state controlled by React (through props and state). Uncontrolled components maintain their own internal state (like DOM elements) and you access their values through refs."
